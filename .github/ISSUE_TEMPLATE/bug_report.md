**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Version information**
Tell us which version of ExRam.Gremlinq you are using.

**Minimal working example**
In descending order of awesomeness, please provide at least one of the following:

* A GitHub repository containing a maximally stripped down (i.e. minimal in regard to
lines of code) executable project that successfully compiles but still exposes the unexpected behaviour.

* A pull request to ExRam.Gremlinq that adds a failing unit test to the ExRam.Gremlinq tests asserting
the expected behaviour. Again, this should be as small as possible to reduce any noise.

In any case: Make it really, really as small as can be. Don't post tons of business POCOs or DTOs that
are not really relevant for exposing the unexpected behaviour. Also, don't post any passwords.

If I can't easily grab your repro code and run it quickly, I may just not bother and nobody else might. 

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
